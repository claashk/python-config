    This adapter turns any class implementing the
    :class:`~schema.ContentHandler` interface into a SAX2 ContentHandler. It
    provides e.g. a convenient way to validate XML input in combination with
    a :class:`~schema.Validator` object: The SaxReader forwards content
    obtained from a SAX2 parser to the :class:`~schema.Validator` object.
    
    Another way to use this reader is to convert xml content to another format
    by using a suitable writer implementaing the :class:`~schema.ContentHandler`
    interface (see e.g. :class:`~schema.WriterBase` or
    :class:`~schema.XmlWriter`).

        SAX parsers are strongly encouraged (though not absolutely required)
        to supply a locator: if it does so, it must supply the locator to the
        application by invoking this method before invoking any of the other
        methods in the DocumentHandler interface.

        The locator allows the application to determine the end position of any
        document-related event, even if the parser is not reporting an error.
        Typically, the application will use this information for reporting its
        own errors (such as character content that does not match an
        applicationâ€™s business rules). The information returned by the locator
        is probably not sufficient for use with a search engine.

        Note that the locator will return correct information only during the
        invocation of the events in this interface. The application should not
        attempt to use it at any other time.
